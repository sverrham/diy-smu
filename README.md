# diy-smu
DIY Source Measurement Unit, four quadrant powersupply and ?.? digit volt/current meter.

This is based on http://www.djerickson.com/diy_smu/index.html but with some changes.

- I plan to use the raspberry pi for control, maybe design a front pannel solution using the compute module.

- I want to miniturize it a bit, change 0805 to 0603 as that is also quite easy to solder by hand.

- I do not have to much experience with the analog part but will let this be project to learn from.
